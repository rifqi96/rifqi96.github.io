# Component Development Guidelines

1. Use Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs with TypeScript
2. Follow naming conventions: PascalCase for components, kebab-case in templates
3. Group imports by type (Vue, libraries, internal)
4. Use strict typing with TypeScript interfaces for object types
5. Place domain-specific components within their respective domain folders
6. Leverage composables for reusable logic
